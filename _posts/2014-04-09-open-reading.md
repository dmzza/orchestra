##### Steinberg's Passion Week (1926)

This previously lost, 88-year-old work of extraordinary significance and powerful beauty receives its first hearing ever, sung in an open reading by the renowned Clarion Choir. Steinberg's music is a bridge between Russiaâ€™s Romantic and Modern schools. He was a student of Rimsky-Korsakov, Liadov, and Glazunov; a classmate of Stravinsky; and teacher and mentor of Shostakovich, who championed this work.
