The Clarion Orchestra performs the American premiere of music from Le fils rival (1787), the final opera written for the Russian court by Dmitri Bortniansky (1751-1825). In a suite compiled by Steven Fox, this music reflects the international culture of the 18th century Russian imperial court and showcases Bortniansky's mastery of styles French, Italian, and Viennese. This extraordinary and unheard work is complemented by Haydn's Overtura Covent Garden and one of the towering symphonic masterpieces of the 18th century, Mozart's 'Jupiter' Symphony. The program features Lauren Snouffer, soprano, and Craig Phillips, bass.
