Clarion presented Baroque works of Latin America, which are only now beginning to be heard in the United States. In as early as the 15th century, Spain began sending priests to the New World to establish churches, missions, and schools. Included in their curriculum was music of a great sophistication, reflecting the best of the European traditions, and, as a result, Latin America responded with a marvelous generation of composers, who engaged the lavish Baroque tradition with fresh ears and new perspectives. The Bolivian Jesuits were extraordinary in the way they fostered musical education, performance, and composition in the 18th century. This concert premiered unknown and unpublished instrumental and vocal masterworks by Bolivian composers of this period.
