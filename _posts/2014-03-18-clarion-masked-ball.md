One of the most exciting new events on New York's musical and social calendar, the annual Clarion Masked Ball is not to be missed! In 2014 we honored one of the worldâ€™s most renowned opera singers, mezzo-soprano Susan Graham. Ms. Graham has sung on the world's leading stages, and returned to the Metropolitan Opera to star as Sycorax in The Enchanted Island. On this evening, Clarion recognized, in particular, her stellar performances of Baroque and Classical repertoire on the opera stage, and the technical virtuosity and unparalleled dramatic energy she has brought to roles of Monteverdi, Purcell, Mozart, Handel, and so many more. The evening included a full dinner, performances of Handel, Vivaldi, and others with Susan Graham and The Clarion Orchestra conducted by Steven Fox, and Baroque dancing led by the BALAM Dance Company.
