There is nothing better than the music of the great Italian Baroque master Antonio Vivaldi to showcase the solo talents of the Clarion Orchestra. The orchestra performs some of the composer's most beloved concerti grossi, each featuring multiple solo instruments and revealing the master's depth of imagination and textural brilliance. The program will include the Concerto in A minor (Op. 3, No. 8), Sinfonia in G minor ‘San Elena al Calvario’, and Winter and Spring from The Four Seasons, with Cynthia Roberts and Owen Dalby, violins.
