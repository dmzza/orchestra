##### Vespers, Op. 37

After last season’s sold-out and widely acclaimed performances in Trinity Wall Street’s Twelfth Night Festival, the Clarion Choir reprises Rachmaninoff’s transcendent Vespers to bring 2014 to a close and to celebrate the arrival of 2015.  Interspersed between the movements will be several ancient Byzantine and Kievan chants that inspired Rachmaninoff’s settings.
