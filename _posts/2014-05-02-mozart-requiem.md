Clarion performs three dramatically different masterpieces from Mozart's final year. From the symmetry and elegance of the overture to The Magic Flute, the joyousness, virtuosity, and humor of the final piano concerto, and finally to the solemnity and gravitas of the Requiem, this program displays Mozart at his technical and emotional apogee.
