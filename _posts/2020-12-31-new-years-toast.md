#### with Rachmaninoff Vespers

Clarion's annual performances of Russian sacred music have garnered critical praise and also become a 
fixture for Classical music lovers on New Year's Eve and Day. While we cannot celebrate together in person 
this year, we invite you to join us for a short online presentation featuring video material from our 
recordings sessions of Rachmaninoff's _Vespers_ earlier this year, and to toast the New Year with us!
