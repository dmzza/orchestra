Clarion hosts its annual Clarion-Collegium Week, featuring an impressive roster of musicians from The 
Clarion Orchestra who will lead five masterclasses in strings, winds, harpsichord, and chamber music. The 
classes are for elementary and high schoolers, college students, and young professionals, at no charge to 
them. Students are invited by a network of Early Music educators to participate in or to observe the 
classes from all over the United States. All Clarion-Collegium programming is free and open to the public.

This year, our programming will focus on "Music from Earlier Pandemics" featuring music from Bubonic Plague 
to the 1918 Flu Pandemic. In addition to masterclasses for musicians, a renowned panel of musicology 
experts will shed light on the glorious music that was created during those earlier challenging times, and 
offer their insights about the future of music performance.

Information and applications will be available soon. Students and young professionals who are interested in 
playing in the master classes, please contact Lauren Ishida at Clarion for reservations and times.
