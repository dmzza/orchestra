##### Tomas Luis de Victoria â€“ Requiem (1608)

In a great marriage of music and setting, Clarion makes its debut at the Metropolitan Museum of Art with one of the great Spanish Renaissance masterpieces, Victoria's Requiem, in the Velez Blanco Patio.  The graceful proportions and delicate stonework of this 16th-century courtyard mirror the pristine beauty, elegance, and solemnity of this timeless work.
