Marking the 500th anniversary of the death of the great Renaissance master, Josquin des Prez, recorder, 
brass, viol and vocal consorts from The Clarion Orchestra and Choir will tell his story: early works 
representing his time as a chorister in Aix-en-Provence; Italian madrigals and frotolli from his time at 
Milan Cathedral and from Rome, where he served as a singer in the Papal Choir; grand works from Ferrara, 
where he was employed by Duke Ercole I; and late works from the final period of his life in 
Condé-sur-l’Escaut.

Over a period of six hours, from 11am - 5pm, the different instrumental and vocal consorts will perform in 
various parts of the Cloisters, including the Romanesque Hall, Cuxa Cloister (outside courtyard), Langon 
Chapel, Saint Guilhem Cloister, and the Boppard Room. All of the singers and players will come together for 
a final performance to end the day in the Fuentidueña Chapel.
