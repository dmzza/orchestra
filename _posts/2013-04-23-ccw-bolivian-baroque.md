Clarion hosted its sixth annual Clarion Collegium Week, which offered two tiers of master classes in Baroque performance practice. The first tier was for college students and young professionals from around the country; the second was for gifted musicians from New York City’s public schools. Classes in violin, flute, cello, oboe, voice and keyboard were taught by the leading Early Music specialists of our time. The week’s curriculum showcased the dazzling Baroque music of Latin America, particularly Bolivia, a great yet largely undiscovered musical center of baroque brilliance in the mid-18th century.
