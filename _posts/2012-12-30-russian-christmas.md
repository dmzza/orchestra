Far from ending Christmas on December 26th, the liturgical calendar continues the celebration for a full twelve days, so Clarion honored this tradition on Sunday, December 30th, sampling centuries of Russian settings of Christmas texts, from the earliest Kievan and Byzantine plain chant through medieval Kievan polyphony, to works for the court of Catherine the Great, and thence to Slavonic settings for the season by Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninoff, Stravinsky, and PÃ¤rt. Co-presented by Trinity Church Wall Street, this a cappella concert included that were, in turn, contemplative, and soaring.
