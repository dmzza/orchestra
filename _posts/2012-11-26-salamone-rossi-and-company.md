Clarion was honored to co-present, with Five Boroughs Music Festival, a program of the Italian-Jewish Baroque master Salamone Rossi, together with music of two of his outstanding contemporaries, Carlo Gesualdo and Claudio Monteverdi. This vocal and instrumental evening expanded on the success of the all-Rossi program that Clarion had presented in recent years in various venues throughout New York. The program displayed the ways in which these three indisputable geniuses influenced each other’s creativity. In keeping with the Festival’s commitment to bringing the best music to all the boroughs of New York, this concert took place in Brooklyn.
