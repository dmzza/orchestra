Clarion hosted its seventh annual Clarion Collegium Week, a week of immersion into 18th-century music. Students participated in master classes on string, wind, brass, keyboard instruments, and voice with some of the worldâ€™s foremost Early Music specialists. The 2014 Week focused on Mozart's music and included lectures and symposia with leading scholars. These programs are free and open to the public to familiarize and engage new audiences with the richness and brilliance of Baroque, Classic and Early Romantic music performed on period instruments.
