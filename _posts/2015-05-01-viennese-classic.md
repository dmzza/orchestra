Principal players of The Clarion Orchestra, led by concertmaster Cynthia Roberts, perform chamber music of the Viennese Classic period: works of Mozart, Haydn, Beethoven, and Hummel. This will be the finale of the Clarion Collegium Week of master classes, which this year spotlight the Viennese classic repertoire.
