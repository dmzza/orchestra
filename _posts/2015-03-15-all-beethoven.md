##### Piano Concerto No. 4 in G Major, Op. 58

##### Symphony No. 6 'Pastoral' in F Major, Op. 68

The Clarion Orchestra explores the sound world of Beethoven with two of his most beloved masterworks on historical instruments.  Brilliant young pianist Nimrod David Pfeffer performs the groundbreaking Fourth Concerto on an early 19th-century fortepiano.  The Orchestra then draws us into Beethoven's wonderfully evocative imagery in the dramatic, programmatic symphony, the 'Pastoral'.
