        <article>
          <h5><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/03/arts/music/clarion-choir-in-rachmaninoffs-vespers.html?smid=pl-share">The New York Times, January 4, 2014</a></h5>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              An inspired interpretation... Under Mr. Fox's deft guidance, the choir’s voices blended beautifully, with alluring details of phrasing and dynamics admirable from the opening... Mr. Fox revealed the drama in the score with vivid dynamic shadings. In 'Blessed Is the Man,' the 'Alleluias' unfolded with characterful contrast; first solemn, then impassioned, before concluding with an introverted whisper. Intonation and pacing were exemplary throughout the performance.

          <h5><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/04/arts/music/bolivian-baroque-at-columbia-university.html">The New York Times, May 3, 2013</a></h5>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              <a href="/about.html#stevenfox">Steven Fox</a>, Clarion’s artistic director, and Sebastián Zubieta, music director of the Americas Society, conducted the beautifully rendered program. Highlights included the exquisite “Dulce Jesús Mio,” a work by an anonymous composer that began with an a cappella solo gracefully sung by Jolle Greenleaf.
            </p>
            <p>
              Estelí Gomez’s clear, bright voice alternated with the choir in “Iesu Dulcissime,” also by an anonymous author. The exchange of text between ensemble and soloist heightened the dramatic tension of Zipoli’s “Beatus Vir,” with the soprano Katia Escalera elegantly rendering the haunting “Misericors.”

                <p>
                  “The singers were particularly impressive. Steven Caldicott Wilson…was formidable in ‘Sound an alarm.’ Both Lauren Snouffer and Silvie Jensen sang with great poise and élan. Daniel Taylor’s Priest reached a whole other level of beauty in “Father of Heav’n.” Indeed, his ability to produce such a wonderful rounded bell-like sound so effortlessly is something from “Heav’n.” Jesse Blumberg sang warmly and sensitively. Commendations are always owed to any and all players of the torturous valveless instruments.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “What can I say about Steven Fox that I haven’t said before? Adding to my last rave review, I can attest that having experienced his recent conducting with two different orchestras, where he achieved similar impressive results, there is no questioning his ability to draw out from musicians their best possible playing. Clearly, he has a tremendous rapport with musicians, and this ability makes him a conductor to follow. “

              <blockquote>
                <p>
                  “Mr. Fox led his small, polished choir and a robust period-instrument band in a brisk, carefully balanced reading, and had the benefit of a solid, well-matched cast of soloists. Steven Caldicott Wilson, the tenor, projected Judas’s valor and faith powerfully, qualities matched by Jesse Blumberg in Simon’s brief appearances. Silvie Jensen, a mezzo-soprano, and Lauren Snouffer, a soprano, are both adept at Handelian filigree and gave beautiful accounts (alone and together) of most of the arias by the unnamed characters. Daniel Taylor, the countertenor, picked up a few of the bit parts, too, and gave an exquisite performance of ‘Father of heav'n!’”

              <blockquote>
                <p>
                  Feldman’s Rothko Chapel… absolutely blew me away. From the four ovations it received, I think the rest of the audience felt similarly. Rothko Chapel became a religious experience in the…ethereal voices of the Clarion Choir. … it was the Clarion Choir’s accuracy and blend that transformed this performance into a transcendent experience.”

                  ...the Clarion Choir gave a pensive and mystical performance of the 30-minute “Rothko Chapel” …The calm, sensitive performance…conveyed the simplicity and directness of this wondrously restrained music. And the audience, which had listened with uncommon contemplativeness, gave the performers a long ovation.

              <blockquote>
                <p>
                  When Bach is performed well, as it was tonight, one could almost think, ‘Why bother with any other music?’ ...a performance as perfect as the one tonight had my mind racing... I had never noticed the beautiful interpolations of the wind solo refrains from the first movement into the final Chorale of the second cantata.  The repartee between the strings and the oboe d'amores, each group in respectful conversation, was new to me. I was mesmerized by the energy, enthusiasm, passion and attention to detail displayed here ... [Steven Fox’s] choice of tempo, his understanding of Bach and Baroque style, and his selection of seldom-heard repertory are unexcelled.

                <p>
                  The music showed imaginative word painting and a rich sonority that one hardly expects to encounter in 18th Century music. Steven Fox conducted with precision and expression… The concert introduced me to composers I have missed and showed me new sides to composers I thought I knew.

                <p>
                  Bernard Haitink and the London Symphony Orchestra loomed like Goliath this week with their complete round of the Beethoven symphonies at Avery Fisher Hall. But on Wednesday evening, as that series hit its climax with the Ninth Symphony, the plucky little Clarion Music Society mounted a significant challenge with a Beethoven concert of its own at the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola on Park Avenue. In terms of novelty and adventure, David won.

                  The venerable Clarion Music Society, founded in 1957, stopped performing in 2001, five years after the death of its founder, Newell Jenkins. But it came back to life early this year with Steven Fox as artistic director, and it is good to have it back.
