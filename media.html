        <h5>George Frideric Handel - Judas Maccabeus</h5>
        <article>
          <h5>Seen and Heard International (UK), May 24, 2013</h5>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              The singers were particularly impressive. Steven Caldicott Wilson…was formidable in ‘Sound an alarm.’ Both Lauren Snouffer and Silvie Jensen sang with great poise and élan. Daniel Taylor’s Priest reached a whole other level of beauty in “Father of Heav’n.” Indeed, his ability to produce such a wonderful rounded bell-like sound so effortlessly is something from “Heav’n.” Jesse Blumberg sang warmly and sensitively. Commendations are always owed to any and all players of the torturous valveless instruments.
            </p>
            <p>
              What can I say about Steven Fox that I haven’t said before? Adding to my last rave review, I can attest that having experienced his recent conducting with two different orchestras, where he achieved similar impressive results, there is no questioning his ability to draw out from musicians their best possible playing. Clearly, he has a tremendous rapport with musicians, and this ability makes him a conductor to follow.

              <blockquote>
                <p>
                  “Mr. Fox led his small, polished choir and a robust period-instrument band in a brisk, carefully balanced reading, and had the benefit of a solid, well-matched cast of soloists. Steven Caldicott Wilson, the tenor, projected Judas’s valor and faith powerfully, qualities matched by Jesse Blumberg in Simon’s brief appearances. Silvie Jensen, a mezzo-soprano, and Lauren Snouffer, a soprano, are both adept at Handelian filigree and gave beautiful accounts (alone and together) of most of the arias by the unnamed characters. Daniel Taylor, the countertenor, picked up a few of the bit parts, too, and gave an exquisite performance of ‘Father of heav'n!’”

            <h5>MORTON FELDMAN - ROTHKO CHAPEL in the Tully Scope Festival</h5>
            <article>
              <h5>Jake Cohen, Consequence of Sound, February 26, 2011</h5>
              <blockquote>
                <p>
                  Feldman’s Rothko Chapel… absolutely blew me away. From the four ovations it received, I think the rest of the audience felt similarly. Rothko Chapel became a religious experience in the…ethereal voices of the Clarion Choir. … it was the Clarion Choir’s accuracy and blend that transformed this performance into a transcendent experience.”
                </p>
              </blockquote>
              <h5>Anthony Tommasini, The New York Times, February 25, 2011</h5>
              <blockquote>
                <p>
                  ...the Clarion Choir gave a pensive and mystical performance of the 30-minute “Rothko Chapel” …The calm, sensitive performance…conveyed the simplicity and directness of this wondrously restrained music. And the audience, which had listened with uncommon contemplativeness, gave the performers a long ovation.
