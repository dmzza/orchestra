          <h3>The Clarion Orchestra</h3>
 
          <!--
          <p>
          <strong>The Clarion Orchestra</strong> 
          is one of the oldest and most highly regarded period-instrument orchestras in America, 
          founded in 1957 by conductor and musicologist Newell Jenkins. Revived in 2006 under the directorship of 
          Steven Fox, the Orchestra has since risen to prominence as a fresh and innovative force on the international 
          period performance scene.
          </p>
          
          <p>
          The ensemble comprises many of the finest period instrument performers in the country, players who are             
          renowned also as chamber music and solo performers.  Many of The Clarion Orchestra's members serve on             
          distinguished faculties, such as The Juilliard School, Mannes School of Music, Yale School of Music, Bard             
          College and SUNY Purchase, among others. The orchestra has performed at Lincoln Center, Carnegie Hall, The             
          Metropolitan Museum, the Frick Collection, the Brooklyn Academy of Music, the Miller Theatre at Columbia             
          University, The Morgan Library, and at Bargemusic, in repertoire that has ranged from the early Baroque to             
          the early Romantic.  The ensemble has received critical acclaim, being called ‘stellar’ and ‘polished’ by             
          <em>The New York Times</em>, and ‘legendary’ by <em>The New Yorker</em>.  In 2009, the Clarion Orchestra was featured in the             
          Brooklyn Academy of Music's critically acclaimed production of Bach's <em>St. Matthew Passion</em>, staged by             
          Jonathan Miller.  In recent years, The Orchestra has been a recipient of several Art Works grants from the             
          National Endowment for the Arts.

          <h3>The Clarion Choir</h3>
          
          <!-- 
          <p>
		 Established in 2006 to complement The Clarion Orchestra, <strong>The Clarion Choir</strong> 
         has become one of the leading professional vocal ensembles in the country.
         </p>
          
          <p>
          With members equally at home on the solo stage and in ensemble singing, The Clarion Choir has received widespread critical acclaim, and was invited to partake in the Lincoln Center White Light Festival as part of the inaugural concert of the new organ at Alice Tully Hall. Later in the same year, the choir was invited back to Lincoln Center to join the Juilliard ensemble Axiom for a performance of Morton Feldman's <em>Rothko Chapel</em> at the Tully Scope Festival, which was praised as a ‘pensive and mystical performance’ by <em>The New York Times</em>. The ensemble has performed at Weill Recital Hall at Carnegie Hall, the Brooklyn Academy of Music, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, Miller Theatre at Columbia University, The Morgan Library, the Quebec International Festival of Sacred Music, The Twelfth Night Festival, and at Bargemusic with The Knights chamber orchestra.  Last season, in a performance hailed as ‘stunning’ by <em>The New York Times</em>, the Choir gave the New York premiere of the lost Russian masterwork, <em>Passion Week</em>, by Maximilian Steinberg, and recorded the work for release this season.

          Recognized as a leader in his generation of conductors, Steven has been called ‘an esteemed director’ by <em>The New Yorker</em>, ‘visionary’ by <em>BBC Music Magazine</em>, and ‘a conductor to watch’ by <em>Seen and Heard International</em>. Of a recent performance with The Clarion Choir, <em>The New York Times</em> praised his ‘deft guidance’ and wrote: ‘An inspired interpretation. Mr. Fox revealed the drama of the score with vivid dynamic shadings. Intonation and pacing were exemplary throughout the performance.’          </p>
          <p>
          Steven graduated as a Senior Fellow with High Honors from Dartmouth College and with ‘distinction’ from the Royal Academy of Music, London, where he was later named an Associate in 2010. He has given master classes and clinics at Dartmouth College, The Juilliard School, and Yale University, where he served for two years as preparatory conductor of the Yale Schola Cantorum.
