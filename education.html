          Launched in 2008, in partnership with the New York Collegium, Clarion Collegium Week (CCW) is the nation’s only program assembling music students of all ages as well as young professionals from all over the United States to learn about the art and techniques of Baroque music and historical performance. The program now offers two tiers of classes, the first for musicians of college age and older, and the second, parallel tier for gifted younger musicians from New York’s high schools and middle schools, with priority given to those from public schools.

          In a week of immersion into 18th-century music, students participate in master classes—on string, wind, brass, and keyboard instruments, and voice—with some of the world’s foremost Early Music specialists. The 2015 Week will focus on music of the Viennese Classic period, with a special focus on the chamber music of Beethoven on original instruments, and will also include lectures and symposia with leading scholars. These programs are free and open to the public to familiarize and engage new audiences with the richness and brilliance of Baroque, Classic and Early Romantic music performed on period instruments.
