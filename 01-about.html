          <h3>The Clarion Orchestra</h3>
          <p>
            The Clarion Orchestra is one of the oldest and most highly regarded period instrument orchestras in the United States. Revived in 2006 by Steven Fox, the orchestra has since risen to prominence as a fresh and innovative force on the international period performance scene.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ensemble comprises many of the finest period instrument performers in the country who are renowned also as chamber music and solo performers. Many of The Clarion Orchestra's members serve on distinguished faculties, such as The Juilliard School, Mannes School of Music, Bard College, and SUNY Purchase, among others. The orchestra has performed at Lincoln Center, Carnegie Hall, the Brooklyn Academy of Music, the Miller Theatre at Columbia University, The Morgan Library, and at Bargemusic, in repertoire that has ranged from the early Baroque to the early Romantic. The ensemble has received critical acclaim, being called ‘stellar’ and ‘polished’ by <em>The New York Times</em>, and ‘legendary’ by <em>The New Yorker</em>. In 2009, the Clarion Orchestra was featured in Brooklyn Academy of Music's critically acclaimed production of Bach's <em>St. Matthew Passion</em>, staged by Jonathan Miller. For the second year in a row, The Clarion Orchestra has been named an NEA ArtWorks recipient.

          <h3>The Clarion Choir</h3>
          <p>
            Established in 2006 to complement the Clarion Orchestra in vocal-orchestral works, The Clarion Choir has since expanded its repertoire far beyond the Baroque and Classical periods and has emerged as one of the country’s preeminent vocal ensembles, demonstrating extraordinary versatility as it performs music from the 16th century to today.
          </p>
          <p>
            With members equally at home on the solo stage and in ensemble singing, The Clarion Choir has received widespread critical acclaim, and was invited to partake in the Lincoln Center White Light Festival as part of the inaugural concert of the new organ of Alice Tully Hall. Later in the same year, the choir was invited to join the Juilliard ensemble Axiom for a performance of Morton Feldman's <em>Rothko Chapel</em> at the Tully Scope Festival, which was praised as a ‘pensive and mystical performance’ by The New York Times. The ensemble has performed at Weill Recital Hall at Carnegie Hall, the Brooklyn Academy of Music, Miller Theatre at Columbia University, The Morgan Library, the Quebec International Festival of Sacred Music, The Twelfth Night Festival, and at Bargemusic with The Knights chamber orchestra.
