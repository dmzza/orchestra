              <h4 class="title">Russian Christmas</h4>
              <h5>Trinity Wall Street</h5>
              <p>Far from ending Christmas on December 26th, the liturgical calendar continues the celebration for a full twelve days, so Clarion honored this tradition on Sunday, December 30th, sampling centuries of Russian settings of Christmas texts, from the earliest Kievan and Byzantine plain chant through medieval Kievan polyphony, to works for the court of Catherine the Great, and thence to Slavonic settings for the season by Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninoff, Stravinsky, and Pärt.  Co-presented by Trinity Church Wall Street, this a cappella concert included that were, in turn, contemplative, and soaring. </p>

              <h4 class="title">Salamone Rossi and Company</h4>
              <h5>Congregation Beth Elohim, Park Slope, Brooklyn</h5>
              <p>Clarion was honored to co-present, with Five Boroughs Music Festival, a program of the Italian-Jewish Baroque master Salamone Rossi, together with music of two of his outstanding contemporaries, Carlo Gesualdo and Claudio Monteverdi.   This vocal and instrumental evening expanded on the success of the all-Rossi program that Clarion had presented in recent years in various venues throughout New York.  The program displayed the ways in which these three indisputable geniuses influenced each other’s creativity.  In keeping with the Festival’s commitment to bringing the best music to all the boroughs of New York, this concert took place in Brooklyn.</p>

              <h4>April 29, 2013</h4>
              <h4 class="title">Bolivian Baroque</h4>
              <h5>St. Paul's Chapel, Columbia University</h5>
              <p>Clarion presented Baroque works of Latin America, which are only now beginning to be heard in the United States.  In as early as the 15th century, Spain began sending priests to the New World to establish churches, missions, and schools.  Included in their curriculum was music of a great sophistication, reflecting the best of the European traditions, and, as a result, Latin America responded with a marvelous generation of composers, who engaged the lavish Baroque tradition with fresh ears and new perspectives. The Bolivian Jesuits were extraordinary in the way they fostered musical education, performance, and composition in the 18th century.  This concert premiered unknown and unpublished instrumental and vocal masterworks by Bolivian composers of this period.</p>

              <p>Clarion hosted its sixth annual Clarion Collegium Week, which offered two tiers of master classes in Baroque performance practice.

Classes in violin, flute, cello, oboe, voice and keyboard were taught by the leading Early Music specialists of our time.  The week’s curriculum showcased the dazzling Baroque music of Latin America, particularly Bolivia, a great yet largely undiscovered musical center of baroque brilliance in the mid-18th century.</p>
