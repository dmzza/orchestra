          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>
            The Clarion Society was founded in 1957 by pioneering musicologist and conductor Newell Jenkins. In the 1970s, it became one of the first New York ensembles to begin performing on period instruments. Today, the Clarion Society is comprised of the renowned Clarion Orchestra, and the celebrated vocal ensemble, the Clarion Choir.
          </p>
          <p>
            Clarion has been presented at Lincoln Center on the White Light and Tully Scope Festivals, and with Juilli<span style="font-style:italic;">a</span>rd415 at Alice Tully Hall. The group has also performed at Weill Recital Hall at Carnegie Hall, the Brooklyn Academy of Music, the Miller Theatre and St. Paul’s Chapel at Columbia University, the Morgan Library, Bargemusic, and the Aston Magna Festival.
          </p>
          <p>
            Clarion recently recorded Handel's Judas Maccabeus (1751 complete version), and this coming year makes its first international appearance under the direction of Steven Fox, at the Quebec City International Festival of Sacred Music.

          <h3>Orchestra</h3>
          <p>
            The Clarion Orchestra brings authentic performances from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries to modern audiences. Composers such as Bach, Mozart, Haydn, Handel, Tchaikovsky and Brahms had a deep understanding and mastery of the instruments they composed for. We feel that utilizing the same instruments and performance practices of the period is integral to the art of recreating their music. This attention to detail reveals the most intimate aspects of their genius.

          <h3>Choir</h3>
          <p>
            Created by Steven Fox as the vocal component of New York’s Clarion Music Society, the Clarion Choir has emerged as one of the country’s preeminent choral groups, with members equally at home on the solo stage and in ensemble singing.  Today, the Choir’s repertoire reaches far beyond its original Baroque roots.  In recent years, the Choir has earned praise not only for its mastery of Monteverdi, Bach, Handel, Haydn, and Mozart, but also for its performances of Stravinsky, Rachmaninoff, Tavener, and Morton Feldman.  The Clarion Choir has performed in the White Light and Tully Scope Festivals in Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, and at Weill Recital Hall at Carnegie Hall, the Brooklyn Academy of Music, Miller Theatre at Columbia University, the Morgan Library, the Aston Magna Festival, and Bargemusic, to widespread critical acclaim.
