		<h4>Alexander Kastalsky - Requiem</h4>
		
		<p>
		
			Alexander Kastalsky was a student of Tchaikovsky and a mentor to Rachmaninov, becoming director of the Moscow Synodal School until the Bolshevik regime banned all sacred music, including the extraordinary 
			<em>Requiem for Fallen Brothers</em> 
			which consequently lay forgotten for over a century. The 
			<em>Requiem</em> 
			is a rich and varied mosaic that honours those who perished in the First World War, poignantly combining Orthodox and Gregorian chant with hymns from the allied nations, even including 
			<em>Rock of Ages</em>. 
			This unprecedented and peerless monument to those who made the ultimate sacrifice was acclaimed on its 1917 premiere as a ‘uniquely Russian requiem that… gave musical voice to the tears of many nations’.

		<p> "The three soloists and four choirs involved have really grasped what is needed to communicate this complex work, and Slatkin's driven direction of the Orchestra of St. Luke's means that the tension never lets up. It may have had to wait until now to be revealed to audiences but this is an extraordinary work and this fine recording will, I am convinced, ensure that it acquires a permanent place in the repertoire."&nbsp;<br>

	<p>&nbsp;"This is essential listening! Conductor Leonard Slatkin does a superb job holding and melding together a variety of choirs, and leading the Orchestra of St. Luke's...An offbeat work that was well worth retrieving from the scrap heap of history..."

	<h4>Alexander Kastalsky - Memory Eternal</h4>
		
	<!-- <p>August 10, 2018 — Recording Release</p>-->
	
	<!--
	<p>The Naxos label will release The Clarion Choir's second recording: Alexander Kastalsky's Memory Eternal written 100 years ago in memory of those who lost their lives in World War I. At the height of his musical career, in response to the unfolding events of the war, Kastalsky undertook to compose a large-scale Requiem that would follow the general plan of the Roman Catholic Requiem Mass but would use musical themes from the Latin rite. The result demonstrates his masterful use of choral sonority and colour, as well as his ability to weave polyphonic textures from ancient chant melodies and their individual melodic motives. This is a poignant a cappella version of the orchestrated work which we will tour and record later in October in collaboration with several other ensembles under the baton of Leonard Slatkin. </p>
	-->
	
	<p>
		
	Released in 2018, this is the world premiere recording of Alexander Kastalsky's Memory Eternal to the Fallen Heroes. The work was written in 1917 to honor those who lost their lives in the First World War.
		
	As the leader of the Moscow Synodal School of Church Singing, Kastalsky was an important influence on Gretchaninoff, Chesnokov and Rachmaninoff, among many others. This work, written at the height of his career, consists of hymns from the Russian Orthodox Memorial Service (Panihida). Memory Eternal to the Fallen Heroes and the three short sacred pieces that end the programme reveal Kastalsky’s masterful use of choral sonority and color, his weaving of complex polyphonic textures, and his graceful use of ancient chant melodies.</p>

		<p>'The Clarion Choir's performance is as ardently passionate as it is immaculate in its balance and pacing...[a] hugely admirable project.'	
		<em></em><br>
		<em><strong>- Jeremy Pound, BBC Music Magazine, Oct 2018</strong></em>
		</p>
		
		
		
		
		<p>‘The rehabilitation of a major work’; this is music powerfully rooted in the Russian sound world, sung with passion, and beautifully recorded.
	
		The Clarion Choir, under the sure direction of Steven Fox, turn in a thrilling performance, recorded with clarity and not too much resonance in St Jean Baptiste Church in New York.

		<p>'The flawless ensemble of The Clarion Choir, under the inspirational direction of Steven Fox, has been perfectly captured in this demonstration class recording. …I can think of no better advocates for this wonderful music than this superb choral ensemble. I shall have no hesitation in nominating this stunning recording as one of my choices of the year.' 	
		<br>
		<em><strong>- Stephen Greenbank, MusicWeb International, Sept 2018</strong></em>

		<p>'This is a superlative performance. Steven Fox is an exemplary leader of his forces, and all three soloists render their parts ably. The recorded sound is crystal clear…'

	<!-- ----------------------- Maximillian Steinberg - Passion Week ------------------------------ -->
	
		<h4>Maximillian Steinberg - Passion Week</h4>
	
	<p> This groundbreaking recording of Steinberg's <em>Passion Week</em> was the second recording ever made of the work, made shortly before The Clarion Choir returned this masterpiece to Russia, where it was written in 1923. Clarion gave the New York premiere of this previously lost choral work in 2014, the Russian premiere performances in St. Petersburg's Grand Philharmonic Hall and Moscow's Church for the Immaculate Conception in 2016, and the UK premiere at the Royal Academy of Music in 2016. </p>

		<p>'... Clarion's handsome voices and the maestro's Slavic sensibilities honor Steinberg's intentions with grand singing and total conviction.'	
		<em></em><br>
		<em><strong>- Philip Greenfield, American Record Guide, Nov 2016</strong></em>
		</p>
		
		
		<p>
		'The sound here is so full, so sating, that I often forget that I’m listening to an a cappella recording, and when I realize it, I’m in awe at what a collection of human voices can pull off without any instrumental accompaniment ... it is awesome.'

		<em><strong>- James Bennett, WQXR, Apr 10, 2020.</strong></em> 
		</p>
		
		
		<p>'Written for the Russian Orthodox Church in the early 1920s by Shostakovich's composition teacher Maximilian Steinberg, this profoundly beautiful choral piece lay forgotten for over 90 years. Performed here with breathtaking sensitivity by an outstanding New York-based choir, it emerges as a work of equal stature to Rachmaninov's justly acclaimed Vespers. A wondful discovery.'
